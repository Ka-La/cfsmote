##CFSMOTE - Continuous Fair SMOTE

The following code includes a minimal example of the implementation of CFSMOTE as well as a file demonstrating how to use the algorithm to apply it to csv-files with data. In the cfsmote_eval.py file, you will have to adapt the paths to local copies of the datasets. Currently, hyperparameters for the algorithm are adapted for Adult, KDD, NYPD and a synthetic dataset.
